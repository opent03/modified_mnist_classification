resnet34 pretrained gives best accuracy 0.953 on held-out validation. froze the first 3 layers.

submission 1 kaggle: resnet34 trained from scratch. kaiming initialization, held out validation accuracy 0.949.

Successfully thresholded image and thinned image
Now training on resnet34
Thinning doesnt work well because numbers that have loops are messed up by the thinning algorithm
Threshold works well on the validation set (in fac, 95.7%) but gives bs predictions for kaggle 
For some reason idk??

Trying squeeze and excitation networks
